ZLottery is a revolutionary decentralized lottery platform that leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology powered by **Zama FHEVM** to provide unprecedented privacy and fairness in blockchain-based gambling. Built on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet, ZLottery ensures that lottery tickets remain completely encrypted and private until the final draw, creating a truly transparent yet confidential gaming experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### What is ZLottery?

ZLottery is an on-chain lottery system where:
- **Ticket Price**: 0.0001 ETH per ticket
- **Number Range**: 2-digit numbers from 11-99 (89 possible combinations)
- **Privacy-First**: All user tickets are encrypted using Zama's FHE technology
- **Provably Fair**: Random number generation using blockchain entropy
- **Self-Service**: Players verify and claim winnings independently
- **Transparent**: All operations are recorded on-chain while maintaining privacy

### Key Innovation: Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Unlike traditional lottery systems where participants must trust a central authority, ZLottery uses **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to:
- Keep all user lottery numbers completely encrypted on-chain
- Allow computation on encrypted data without revealing the numbers
- Enable users to independently verify their winnings

4. **High Fees**: Significant operational costs and intermediary fees
5. **Slow Payouts**: Manual verification and payment processes
6. **Limited Accessibility**: Geographic and regulatory restrictions

### **ZLottery's Innovative Solutions**

1. **Complete Transparency**: All operations occur on public blockchain
2. **Absolute Privacy**: FHE ensures ticket numbers remain encrypted
3. **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of control or failure

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### **Fully Homomorphic Encryption Implementation**

ZLottery leverages Zama's FHEVM to perform computations on encrypted data:

```solidity
// Store encrypted ticket
euint8 ticketNumber = FHE.fromExternal(encryptedNumber, inputProof);
userTickets[currentRound][msg.sender].push(ticketNumber);

// Grant access permissions
FHE.allowThis(ticketNumber);
FHE.allow(ticketNumber, msg.sender);

// Compare encrypted ticket with public winning number
ebool isWinner = FHE.eq(userTicket, FHE.asEuint8(winningNumber));
```

### **Random Number Generation**

Secure randomness using multiple entropy sources:

```solidity
uint256 randomSeed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    block.timestamp,        // Current block timestamp
    block.prevrandao,       // Previous block randomness
    block.number,           // Current block number
    msg.sender,             // Transaction sender
    totalTicketsInRound[currentRound], // Number of tickets
    currentRound            // Current round number
)));

uint8 winningNumber = uint8((randomSeed % 89) + 11); // Map to valid range
```

### **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Numbers encrypted before leaving user's device
2. **On-Chain Storage**: Only encrypted data stored on blockchain
3. **Computation on Encrypted Data**: FHE enables operations without decryption
4. **Selective Revelation**: Only winning status revealed, not ticket numbers

## 📊 Gas Optimization & Cost Analysis

### **Transaction Costs (Estimated)**
- **Buy Ticket**: ~150,000 gas (~$3-5 USD at current prices)
- **Draw Lottery**: ~80,000 gas (~$2-3 USD)
- **Check Ticket**: ~60,000 gas (~$1-2 USD)
- **Claim Prize**: ~50,000 gas (~$1-2 USD)

### **Optimization Strategies**
